Move to release page\n2. Download the file for your platform.\n3. Just run the file.(java needed. Most of the conditions are the same as the original version.)\n\n### Information\n\n- Discord : _https://discord.gg/g8R9XTK_\n\n### Translating support\n\n1. move to core/asset/bundle/\n2. open bundle_(language code).properties\n3. Compare and work with bundle.properties.\n4. If you need more advice, read Translating.md\n\n`_Translating is similar to the original._`\n\n### Or...\nIf you want to experience the latest version, please follow the instructions below.\n\n\u203b All builds must be done with commands within the master folder.\n\n#### Windows\n\n_Running:_ `gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `gradlew desktop:dist`\n\n#### Linux/Mac OS\n\n_Running:_ `./gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `./gradlew desktop:dist`\n\n#### Server\n\nServer builds are bundled with each released build (in Releases). If you'd rather compile on your own, replace 'desktop' with 'server', e.g. `gradlew server:dist`.\n\n#### Android\n\n1. Install the Android SDK [here.](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) Make sure you're downloading the \"Command line tools only\", as Android Studio is not required.\n2. Create a file named `local.properties` inside the Mindustry directory, with its contents looking like this: `sdk.dir=<Path to Android SDK you just downloaded, without these bracket>`. For example, if you're on Windows and installed the tools to C:\\\\tools, your local.properties would contain `sdk.dir=C:\\\\tools` (*note the double backslashes are required instead of single ones!*).\n3. Run `gradlew android:assembleDebug` (or `./gradlew` if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in `android/build/outputs/apk`.\n4. (Optional) To debug the application on a connected phone, do `gradlew android:installDebug android:run`. It is **highly recommended** to use IntelliJ for this instead, however.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\nIf the terminal returns `Permission denied` or `Command not found` on Mac/Linux, run `chmod +x ./gradlew` before running `./gradlew`. *This is a one-time procedure.*\n\n---\n\nGradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br>\nAfter building, the output .JAR file should be in `/desktop/build/libs/Mindustry.jar` for desktop builds, and in `/server/build/libs/server-release.jar` for server builds.\n", "version": null, "wiki": null, "date": "2019-12-18 15:43:53", "header": "", "delta_ago": "30 days"}, {"name": "\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0443", "link": "https://github.com/Prosta4okua/Ukrajinisator", "desc": "\u041d\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0442\u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438!", "icon": null, "icon_raw": "", "stars": 1, "author": "Prosta4ok_ua", "date_tt": 1576622507.0, "repo": "Prosta4okua/Ukrajinisator", "contents": [], "assets": ["bundles"], "displayName": null, "issue": null, "readme": "# Ukrajinisator\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440. \u0426\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043e.\n", "version": "1", "wiki": null, "date": "2019-12-17 17:41:47", "header": "", "delta_ago": "a month"}, {"name": "Materialplus", "link": "https://github.com/Lukince/Material-Plus", "desc": "This mod is Material Plus Mod for Mindustry.", "icon": "images/material-plus-icon.png", "icon_raw": "sprites/blocks/uranium-reactor.png", "stars": 2, "author": "lukince", "date_tt": 1576522904.0, "repo": "Lukince/Material-Plus", "contents": ["blocks", "items", "liquids"], "assets": ["content", "sounds", "bundles", "sprites"], "displayName": null, "issue": null, "readme": "# Info\nThis mod is Material Plus Mod for Mindustry\n\n[https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry]\n\n1.0 Version hasn't sprites.\n\nTranslation:\nKorean : Lukince\nEnglish(Fix) : Phythongaming\n\nBug(Translation) report : reportbug0@gmail.com\"\n\n# Version Update\n\n- 1.0\n\nTurrets : 5 Turrets are Updated\n\nBlock : 3 Forges and 1 Reactor are Updated\n\nItem : 2 Items are Updated\n\nLiquid : 1 Liquid is Updated\n\n- 1.01 Patch Note\n\nTwo blocks are patched.\n\nUranium Forge : Power changed, Power : 4,000 -> 1,000\n\nUranium Melter : Power and craftTime changed, Power : 3,000 -> 600, craftTime : 2sec -> 0.92 sec\n\nAdd two sprites : Titanium forge and Ion generator.\n\nTranslate Titanium forge\n", "version": "1.01", "wiki": null, "date": "2019-12-16 14:01:44", "header": "", "delta_ago": "a month"}, {"name": "Better Builds Mod", "link": "https://github.com/pyro000/Mindustry-BetterBuildsMod", "desc": "Mod dise\u00f1ado por Ruben, el cual trae diversos items nurvos, como nether, estrellas, obsidiana, lingotes nucleares, torretas, un proyector de fuerza...

Nanotech\n\nThis is a Mindustry .json mod based on a new custom ore, Niobium. It is intented to be a mid-upper tier extention of the vanilla content, balanced to provide modest damage at superior range while being vulnerable to force projectors.\n\nI plan to include an attack map to demonstrate the unique advantages/disadvantages of the turrets in the future.  More structures may also follow if I get into source modding or the .json capabilities are expanded.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/Retrothopter/Niobium-Nanotech/blob/master/PreviewTurretFire.png)\n# Content Detail\n\nNiobium: A specialized material used to produce superconducting electromagnets and nanotechnology.\n\nNanotech Compound: Explosive nanites packed into a stable mesh.\n\nNanite Assembler:  Assembles Nanotech Compound.\n\nGorilla: A specialized railgun. Uses superconducting electromagnets to fire explosive nanite slugs at extreme range.\n\nCrucible: Mantains a pool of active nanites for quick deployment.

[ ] Configurable crafters - Crafters where you can choose what to manufacture.\n   - [ ] Addon modules - Blocks that enhance or modify the functionality of related crafters.\n   - [ ] [Power production](#power-production) - Power generation using steam\n   - [ ] [Oil distillation](#oil-distillation) - Use vanilla oil to produce\n    more refined oils.\n   - [ ] [Factories](#factories) - Produce new items/liquids\n   - [ ] [Workforce](#workforce) - New aircraft and mechs for utility/defense/offence \n   - [ ] [Logic System](#logic-system) - Basic logic circuit components.\n   \n### Power production\n- Steam Power\n    - Steam Pressure\n        - Low pressure steam - moderate heat\n        - High pressure steam - high heat (causes damage on contact)\n    - Steam Boilers\n        - Outputs steam (used for power and oil distillation)\n        - Inputs\n            - Water (vanilla)\n            - Distilled water (more efficient)\n        - Types\n            - Solid Fuelled - Burns items (similar to vanilla steam generator)\n                - Coal - produces low pressure\n                - Blast - produces low pressure\n                - Pyrite - produces high pressure\n            - Liquid Fuelled - Burns liquid fuel\n                - Crude Oil\t(vanilla) -

Low - less power, less distilled water\n            - High - more power, more distilled water\n- Gas Power\n    - Gas Turbine - Use natural gas for power.\n\n### Oil Distillation\nInspiration from oil refining in other games/mods and also from the image below.\n\n![Test](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TSvZKkzZ9mY/V9PhdzD344I/AAAAAAAAAGI/3B3Q4EkLhAMfY6es3CeUYzzDTxlWGEavACLcB/s1600/oil-distillation.gif)\n(Image from [here](http://allabtinstru.blogspot.com/2016/09/ProcessofRefiningCrudeOil.html))\n- Distillation Tower - Used in the refining of crude oil\n    - Outputs\n        - Lubricant - Used as a booster for new crafters (less power/less craft time)\n        - Fuel Oil - Used in liquid fuelled boilers for high pressure steam\n- Cracking Unit - Addon for distillation tower\n    - Additional outputs\n        - Kerosene - Used for new unit fuelling\n        - Propane - Used for power generation\n        - Diesel - Used for new unit fuelling        \n\n### Factories\n- TODO\n    -
