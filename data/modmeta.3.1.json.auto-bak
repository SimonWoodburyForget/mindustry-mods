All languages are supported!\n### Versioning\nThe number before `.` indicates the algorithm version and the number after `.` indicates the build version. For example, `2.3` means that the version is the third build made with algorithm version 2. Every build has different texts.\n## Regenerating bundles\nIf you want to, you can regenerate the bundles to have different texts.\n### You need:\n- Python 3\n- [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify/blob/master/README.md#installation)\n- A terminal\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Open the terminal and navigate to the root of the mod directory\n2. Put the source bundles you want to use to the directory `Mindustry/core/assets/bundles`\n3. Type `python3 randomiser.py`\n4. Wait.

\"resources-bronze/2\"`\n\n## As a library for your own items\nSee example code below:\n```js\nconst res = this.global.resources;\nres.add(\"cool-alloy\", \"ingot-alloy\", Color.valueOf(\"#00aaff\"), {});\n// Or JSON style\nres.add({\n\t\"cool-alloy\": {\n\t\t\"mask\": \"resources-ingot-alloy\",\n\t\t\"color\": \"#00aaff\"\n\t}\n});\n```\n\nThen add bundles as needed:\n```\nitem.coolmod-cool-alloy.name = Cool Alloy\nitem.coolmod-cool-alloy.description = B)\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nBy default, the new item's type is set to `ItemType.material`.\n\nIf you do not want this, override it with `\"def\": {\"type\": ItemType.resource}`\n\nColor should be the brightest part of the texture.\n\n\nFor JSON style item adding, the object argument must contain any number of objects in the following formats:\n```json\n\"itemname\": {\n\t\"color\": \"color\",\n\t\"mask\": \"modname-mask-texture\",\n\t\"def\": {\n\t\t\"extra\": \"fields for Item\"\n\t}\n}\n```\nOR\n```\n\"itemname\": \"color\"\n```\n\nThe mask may be one of the following builtin masks, prefixed with `resources-`:\n* ingot-alloy (Surge Alloy based)\n* ingot-dull (Lead based)\n* ingot-rare (Titanium based)\n* ingot-shiny (Copper based, default)\n* dust (Sand based)\n* clump (Coal based)\nor your own.\n\nColor may be:\n* #rrggbbaa\n* #rrggbb\n* color name, see Color.java and Pal.java\n* 32 bit int color value in decimal\n* an explicitly defined `Color` value\n\nIf you see a color of #FF00FF, (#FF00FFFF in rgba) it means that your colour failed to parse.\n\n\nadd(String, String, Color, Object) returns the newly created Item.\n\nadd(Object<itemname, Object>) returns an object of *itemname* -> Item\n\n", "version": "0.1.0", "wiki": null, "date":
