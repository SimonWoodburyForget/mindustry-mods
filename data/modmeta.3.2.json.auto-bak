Providing penalty for your failure.\n   \n  \n  *Note: The tile edges are still there, I'm currently trying to figure out the most efficient way possible to remove it.\n  \n\u2022 Power\n  > Chamberlock Platform\n    End current game, or test chamber.\n  > Hard Light Bridge Projector\n    Converts light using power into a \"hard light\" walkable bridge tile. Requires power to activate.\n  > Hard Light Bridge Tile\n    A walkable hard light bridge tile created from it's projector.\n  > Pedestal Button\n    Outputs power for a while when something is on top of it.\n  > Rectangular Heavy Duty Super Button\n    Outputs power for as long as there's something above or on it.\n  > Power Circle\n    Transfers power to another power transferer or block that is next to it. Turns to yellow when power status is true.\n  > Power Hollow\n    Same with power circle, except it's now shaped like a ring. Usually placed in corners.\n  > Power Transparent\n    Same with the other power transferers, now it's transparent. Used when transferring power to an even number sized block.\n  \n\u2022 Producer\n  > Storage Cube Launcher\n    Block that launches weighted storage cube.

Requires power to open.\n  \nUnits\n\n\u2022 Ground Unit\n  > Weighted Storage Cube\n    A cube that can be moved around to accomplish stuff in a test chamber.\n  > Weighted Companion Cube\n    A modified version of the weighted storage cube. It has a pink heart this time.\n  > Sentry Turret\n    A sentry turret unit that shoots at test subject in it's prespective. It can't rotate or move. \n    \n    *Note: For sentry, only use in the opposite team of the test subject, and it's not meant to be pushed around.\n  \nItems\n\n\u2022 Liquids\n  > Repulsion Gel\n    A blue gel with an unknown use since jump boost doesn't make sense in this game mechanics.\n  > Propulsion Gel\n    An orange gel that gives speed boost to anything that's on it.\n  > Conversion Gel\n    Liquidified moon rocks that can turn your non-portal conductor surface to a portal conductor surface!\n    \n    *Note: These liquids are still in development, and portals are not here yet..\n````\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "version": "0.3.1 dev", "wiki": null, "date": "2020-07-29 06:01:00", "header": "https://github.com/Gdeft/aperture-science/blob/master/sprites-override/ui/logo.png"}, {"name": "starwars", "name_markup": "[red]Star[white]Wars", "link": "https://github.com/SnakkiZXZ/StarWarsMod", "desc": "\u0414\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430", "desc_markup": "[white]\u0414\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430", "icon": null, "stars": 5, "author": "Snakki", "author_markup": "[white]Snakki", "date_tt": 1596014050.0, "repo": "SnakkiZXZ/StarWarsMod", "contents": ["mechs", "blocks", "units", "zones", "items"], "assets": ["content", "scripts", "sprites", "schematics", "sounds"], "displayName": "[red]Star[white]Wars", "issue": null, "readme": "# StarWarsMod\nmodification for the game mindustry.

When team is -1, the team is set to the executor's team.   \nFails if the previous block is already the same as the current block.   \n`replace` destroys the previous block, and sets a new block. (default)   \n`keep` only sets the block if previous block is Air.   \n`build` destroys the previous block, and sets a new block, as if a player built it.   \n`force` sets a new block. crashes the game if the previous block is a tile entity.   \n\n### /execute\nExecutes a command from another tile or unit's perspective.  \nFails if the executed command fails, or the tile or entity is not found.   \n`execute` is optional, one can start a command with `at/as`   \n  + /execute at pos:x pos:y string:command   \n    Executes as a tile at x,y.   \n  + /execute as target:target string:command   \n    Executes as a target.   \n\n### /f(/function) string:functionname (arguments)\nRuns a function of the executor called functionname.

Fails if coordinates are below 0.   \n\n### /playsound string:effect (pos:x pos:y) (int:volume)   \nPlays a sound on the given position. Fails if coordinates are below 0. Default volume is 0.5.   \n\n### /give string:item (int:amount)\nGives the executor an amount of an item.   \nIf the executor is a tile, amount may be negative.   \nFails if amount is negative and executor is not a tile, or amount is negative and less than 1 items were removed.   \n\n### /clear      \nClears the executor of the item. Fails if the executor does not have an inventory.   \n  - /clear string:item   \n    if the executor is a tile. Fails if less then 1 items are removed.   \n  - /clear  \n    if the executor is an unit.   \n\n### /effect target:target string:statuseffect (int:duration) (int:level) (boolean:hideparticle)\nGives the executor a status effect for the given duration of seconds.   \nFails if executor is not an unit. Some effects are custom potion effects, which are affected by the given level and hideparticle.   \n`speed` sets speedMultiplier to level\\*0.1+1.1.   \n`slowness` sets speedMultiplier to -1\\*level\\*0.05+0.95.   \n`strength` sets damageMultiplier to level\\*0.1+1.1.   \n`weakness` sets damageMultiplier to -1\\*level\\*0.05+0.95.   \n`resistance` sets armorMultiplier to level\\*0.2+1.1.   \n`pain` sets armorMultiplier to -1\\*level\\*0.05+0.95.   \n`poison` gives damage of 0.05\\*level+0.05 every frame. Kills, unlike what it looks like.   \n`wither` gives damage of 0.1\\*level+0.1 every frame. Kills.   \n`instant_damage` gives damage of 10\\*level+10. Duration is overridden.   \n`burning, freezing, wet, melting, tarred, overdrive, shielded, shocked, corroded, boss` are vanilla status effects. Refer [here](https://simonwoodburyforget.github.io/mindustry-modding/#StatusEffect).   \n`SPEED MULTIPLIERS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO WORK FOR PLAYERS, MAY RESULT IN UNEXPECTED BEHAVIORS SUCH AS CRASHES.`   \n\n### /kill (target:target)      \nKills the target. The target is the executor if unspecified. Fails if the target is not an unit.   \n\n### /assert      \nThe executor asserts dominance.   \n\n### /configure pos:x pos:y (int|boolean:value)      \nConfigures a block at the specified position to a value.   \nDoors accept boolean, others accept intergers. Value may be unspecified for doors(then it will toggle).   \nFails if the block is not configurable, or if it is a door that is already in the given state.   \n\n### /tp target:target\nTeleports a target to a destination.  \nFails if the destination is an array of multiple targets.   \n  + /tp target:target target:destination (facing) (float:angle)   \n    Teleports to the destination's coordinates. The destination target must specify only one entity.   \n    Angle may use tilde notation to add to the current rotation.   \n  + /tp target:target pos:x pos:y (facing) (float:angle)   \n    Teleports to the specified coordinates.   \n    Angle may use tilde notation to add to the current rotation.   \n\n### /summon string:unittype (pos:x pos:y) (int:team)   \nSummons an unit at the specified position. Fails if coordinates are below 0.   \nTeam should be -1 and 255, default is -1. When team is -1, the team is set to the executor's team.   \nOnly vanilla units may be summoned with the exception of the armor stand, which can be summoned with `armorstand`.   \n\n### /fire(/shoot) string:bullet (pos:x pos:y) (float:angle) (int:team) (float:velocity) (float:lifetime) (boolean:bind)   \nFires a bullet at the specified position. Fails if coordinates are below 0.   \nAngle may use tilde notation to add to the current rotation.    \nTeam should be -1 and 255, default is -1. When team is -1, the team is set to the executor's team.   \nVelocity and lifetime are multipliers, and defalts are 1.   \nBind is whether the executor becomes the owner of the bullet, default is false.   \n\n### /attribute string:attributename (boolean|int|type:state)   \nSets an attribute or gets an attribute of the executor. Fails if the executor is not a tile.   \nCan only be used inside an /execute.   \nRefer [here](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/blob/v104.6/core/src/mindustry/world/Block.java) for the list of attributes.   \n\n### /do   \nA command that does nothing on its own but the `$ notation`s are parsed nonetheless. NEVER fails on its own, meaning chained conditional command blocks will always activate.   \n\n### /check (argument)   \nA command that does nothing on its own but the `$ notation`s are parsed nonetheless. Fails if the first argument is false or when parsed, returns false.   \n\n## Tilde Notation   \nUsing ~ before a number for a coordinate will get the coordinate relative to the executor.   \nAll coordinates are based on the tile coordinate, not the world coordinate.    \n\n## Refer a Type   \nFor a param that is not a string/int, the following syntax is used in `/f(and its counterparts)`, `/gamerule`, and `/attribute`.   \n`tile|tileblock|tileent:x,y` `team:teamnumber` `block|floor|item|fx|liquid|bullet:name` `seffect:statuseffectname` `target:targetselector` `js:null|undefined|this|true|false`\n\n## Target Selectors   \n`@s` The executor of the command.\n`@sb` The block of the executor of the command.\n`@se` The tile entity of the executor of the command.\n`@p` The player(not to be confused with a single player).   \n`@a` All players.   \n`@u` All units except players.   \n`@t` Is a `this` of the origin command block. Use only when you know what you are doing.   \n`@c[tagname]` A cache of the unit tagged by the Unit Tagger.   \n`x,y` The tile at the position.   \n`@e` All entities. Tile entities are excluded by default. Target arguments may be used.   \nA string will refer to a player with that name.   \n\n### Target Arguments   \nTarget arguments filter targets.   \nThe format is `[argument1=value,argument2=value,...]`, and `=!` may replace `=` to exclude, not include.   \nUse it next to Target Selectors with no whitespace in between. For example: `@e[type=unit]`.   \n+ type(string)   \n  `player` `unit`(excludes players) `mob`(players&units) `bullet` `tile`(tile entity, not a tile) `effect` `groundEffect` `alleffect`(effects&groundEffects) `puddle` `shield` `fire`   \n+ name(string)   \n+ team(int)   \n  -1 for the team of the executor.   \n+ x y dx dy(pos)   \n  filters in a rectangle, refer [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#Target_selector_arguments).   \n+ r(float)\n  filters in a circle, the radius is in tiles.   \n\n## Block List   \nThis is the full list of blocks, as

Open the terminal and navigate to the root of the mod directory\n2. Put the source bundles you want to use to the directory `Mindustry/core/assets/bundles`\n3. Type `python3 randomiser.py`\n4. Wait.

Stalkers cannot be manufactured on the surface, \nso they are constructed on mothership and are sent to the drop points on request. \nPlease do not toss them at enemies' meltdowns and spectres, Stalkers are quite expensive.  \nWeapon: Proton Pulsators  \nWeapon damage: 16  \n*Weapon shots: 14  \n*Shotgun Based Weapon  \nHealth: 600  \nMine speed: 150%  \nDrillpower: 100%  \nBuildpower: 90%  \nStorage: 48  \n\nReaver Ship  \nHeavy assault gunship, designed for air-ground support actions. \nArmed with heavy A100 minigun at the cost of weak construction and mining projectors. \nWhile 'Reaver' is gunship's official name, people often call it 'Black Pearl' or 'Flying Dutchman'. \nAnd now this ship is literally associated with legends of space pirates.  \nWeapon: A100  \nWeapon damage: 14  \nHealth: 1250  \nMine speed: 50%  \nDrillpower: 100%  \nBuildpower: 50%  \nStorage: 120  \n\n**Yamato Battlecruiser  \n510 years of inhuman experiments on a Meltdown turrets led us to this pinnacle of spacecraft. \nArmed with amplified version of Meltdown, that does not overheat, comes with pre-installed internal impact reactor \nthat fuels the Meltdown onboard. And best part is that this abomination can actually move!  \n*Weapon: Meltdown  \n*Exactly  \nHealth: 5000  \nMine speed: 0%  \nDrillpower: 0%  \nBuildpower: 100%  \nStorage: 600  \n**In the near future will be either removed from the mod or fully reworked in favor of a unigue weapon and ability, rather then meltdown.  \n\nV1.3 coming soon:\n- New Mech\n- New Ship\n- Yamato rework\n\nV1.2 strikes:\n- Reaver ship was resprited\n- Minor balance tweaks\n- Mech weapon is now specified in the database\n\nV1.1:  \n- Mod updated to the newest build 100  \n- Added russian localisation | \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f.  \n- Buffed Sister attackspeed, raising her combat and healing capabilities while not making them utter good.  \n- Lowered build cost for Sister Ship Pad - Updated sprites for Yamato Construction Facility(Meltdown Ship Pad) and Reaver bullets.  \n- Reaver weapon rework. Raised bullet velocity, no longer keeps ship velocity.  \n- Yamato weapon rework. Behaves like real meltdown beam, holding itself. When ship is idle, beam will start sweeping in an arc.  \n- I finally figured out how github works.  \n", "version": "1.2", "wiki": null, "date": "2020-01-24 17:03:20", "header": ""}, {"name": "Applied Energistics mindustry edition", "name_markup": "Applied Energistics [gray]mindustry edition", "link": "https://github.com/Mya4ta/AE", "desc": "Applied Energistics add big store for you core", "desc_markup": "Applied Energistics add big store for you core", "icon": null, "stars": 2, "author": "bedfun", "author_markup": "bedfun", "date_tt": 1579900911.0, "repo": "Mya4ta/AE", "contents": ["items", "blocks"], "assets": ["bundles", "sprites", "content"], "displayName": null, "issue": null, "readme": "", "version": "0.03", "wiki": null, "date": "2020-01-24 16:21:51", "header": ""}, {"name": "My first mod", "name_markup": "My first mod", "link": "https://github.com/nikita202/mindustry_mod", "desc": "Dont use it.
