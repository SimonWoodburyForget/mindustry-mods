<h1>Unofficial Mindustry Lore</h1>
<p>From the start humanity faced lack of resources, this in turn started a chain reaction of projects that aimed to fix humanities resource problems, one in particular stands above all, </p>
<p><strong>Project mindustry</strong></p>
<p>project mindustry in the meantime became the most successful project ever,</p>
<p>Project mindustry rapidly advanced through technology and discovered  space travel technology, efficient mining, recycling, and waste reduction, which fixed all of the problem humanity previously had</p>
<p>Humans relaxed and lived in peaceful life as with too much resources theres no space for war, with humans brushing aside the risk, mindustry was no longer being maintained properly, this resulted in the birth of cybernetic species called crux, crux managed to gain control of most human made systems and started driving humanity to extinction, luckily for the humans in the mindomeda galaxy where theres little contact are safe and their presence was forgotten,</p>
<p>Crux ordered everything that resembles or gives memories about human existance be destroyed,</p>
<p>fortunately it wasnt long till a group of crux droids learnt about what crux previously did, and there sharded was born, with such belief sharded spread really fast, but in the end they lost motivation as nobody know if humans did exist and if they were real, </p>
<p>Base after base, betrayal between allies, and core by core, sharded lost, this events didn't last long as there was a control signal intercepted by one of the sharded motherships, one thing for sure it came from the "spirits", a government of humans who stated they are better than what they used to be, </p>
<p>Sharded quickly researched and started the production of "shells" for the "spirits control" to use, this turned the tide of war very quickly as the humans know how crux moves.</p>
